# everything*DOCUMENT 1: THE WHITE HOUSE MEMORANDUM**

**TOP SECRET // SCI // EYES ONLY**

**MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT**

**FROM:** NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (VIA K SYSTEMS & SECURITIES)
**SUBJECT:** Project Golden Dome: A Definitive Solution to the Ballistic Missile Threat and the End of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)

**Mr. President,** for imperative reasons, American national security has been predicated on the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). These systems have cost trillions of dollars in layered and redundant offensive and defensive systems. Against a peer or near-peer nation, the problem of a nuclear attack on the American homeland remains the single greatest existential risk to the nation. This is the unavoidable problem of our time and the one we are protected to solve.

**2. The Technological Solution: Project Golden Dome**

The ‘K-Golden Dome’ is a satellite-based defensive system, built by the private research entity K Systems and Securities. It is not an improvement on existing technology; it is the practical application of a new category of physics.

*   It provides a 100% effective, impenetrable, and non-lethal defense against all current and projected ballistic missile attacks.
*   It provides a multi-layered, perfect defense that provides a series of specialized energy fields based on a revolutionary new understanding of physics. It protects at every stage of their trajectory.
*   **Boost-Phase Neutralization:** The moment a hostile launch is detected, the Dome projects a targeted “bubble” of coherent energy. This completely and harmlessly neutralizes the missile, rendering its warheads inert.
*   It makes the ballistic missile arsenals of all potential adversaries, including Russia and China, completely and permanently obsolete. It is the single largest shift in the global balance of power since the development of the atomic bomb.
*   **Mr. President,** this is an immediate and an existential strategic freedom of action in foreign policy, unconstrained by the threat of nuclear Armageddon. The foundational science is complete and has been verified. We are not waiting on a scientific breakthrough; we are here to deliver it.
